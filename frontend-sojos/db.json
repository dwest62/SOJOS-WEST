Our core will get us back to business the following week.  For this week, bring any outdoor games you might like to play.  If we need a topic of discussion for the evening between gaming, feel free to share your favorite moment/experience from this summer.\n\nWe look forward to seeing everyone (the people without cool plans for the holiday weekend)\n\nDan, David, James, Kevin, and Nayt"
